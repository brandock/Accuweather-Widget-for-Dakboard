# Accuweather-Widget-for-Dakboard

I wanted a certain kind of bar graph showing the next several hours and two days of weather forecast, similar to the old iOS web app from Accuweather. And I wanted it to work with our Dakboard as a web widget. This is rough but it works. I run it on a Raspberry Pi web server.
